** A media tracking and aggregation system that can be used to build presentations. **

The goal of the system is to make building presentations easier.  Many presentations need to 
evolve over time but often use assets from previous versions or even other presentations. 
If presentation assets can be organized and tracked so that the basic structure of presentations 
can be put together by selecting and ordering these existing assets, it would make creating 
and maintaining these presentations much easer.

* Assets that could be tracked include:
  * Slide content
  * Images
  * Charts and graphs
  * Links and their thumbnails
  * Code samples

* Some key features of the system may be:
  * Generate presentations in multiple formats and with different themes and aspect ratios
  * Allow the regeneration of all presentations containing a slide or image when that asset changes
  * Support the labeling of states so that a presentation can be regenerated as it was at a particular point in time


Prototypes and contribution guidelines are forthcoming.
