A media tracking and aggregation system that can be used to build presentations.

The goal of the system is to make building presentations easier.  Many presentations need to evolve over time but often use assets from previous versions or even other presentations. If presentation assets can be organized and tracked so that the basic structure of presentations can be put together by selecting and ordering these existing assets, it would make creating and maintaining these presentations much easer.

Assets that could be tracked include:

* Slide content
* Images
* Charts and graphs
* Links and their thumbnails
* Code samples

Prototypes and contribution guidelines are forthcoming.
